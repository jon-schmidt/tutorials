# Managing Tasks with NPM

It's never boring as a Javascript developer (unless you find constant change
boring...). The library/framework ecosystem of npm presents a uniquely chaotic
occupational hazard while also featuring possibly the finest tool in the land
"out-of-the-box". npm The cli Tool<sup>TM</sup> offers the greatest flexibility
and reliability that I'm aware of. The common practice of providing cli tools
with npm packages allows (generally) the same functionality without the neccessity
of managing a build tool's plugins. Faced with the uncertainty of the Javascript
ecosystem, `npm run` presents a powerful option to run tasks (scripts) - complete with
pre and post hooks.
